### My Experience

The Psychedelic Science 2023 conference was an immersive and enlightening experience for me. As soon as I entered the Colorado Convention Center, I was met with an atmosphere charged with the energy and anticipation of thousands of attendees, each there with the shared goal of exploring and understanding the world of psychedelics.

### What I Learned

Throughout the five-day conference, I attended numerous lectures, panels, and workshops led by experts in the field. I was particularly struck by the presentation by A Conversation with Amanda Feilding and Rick Doblin, Ph.D., who spoke about conducting landmark studies with brain imaging. The insights I gained from this session alone have fundamentally shifted my understanding of LSD, MDMA, DMT and Psilocybin.

Another highlight was the workshop on Psychedelics as THe Great Disrupters: Reconstructing the Future of Mental Healthcare, led by Dr. Ben Sessa. The hands-on experience and the opportunity to interact directly with experts and fellow attendees provided invaluable practical knowledge that I will certainly apply in my life, family, friends, and mental health in general.

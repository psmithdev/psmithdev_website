Training for a full in 1-2 months

Another Half at Mystic May 15th.  Time was 1:44 which was a huge improvement!  That will be tough to beat for the next one.

I haven't been running since the half on the 15th.  I think I have a minor foot injury from the race.  I learned a few things.

Icing everyday helps. Same with foot massage.  I have a small roller that works well.  The pain is in the right foot on the side.  Not underneath.  If it persists for another week or two, off to the doctor's I go.  Very frustrating.

I think switching to a new shoe that is much thinner was part of the problem, and pushing myself a little too much.

My foot is not broken!! Hooray!!

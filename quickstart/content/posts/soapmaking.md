Part of being self-sufficient is knowing how to make your own stuff, and piggy backing off of bread, now I'll introduce soap. Coincidentally, the recipe I am using is just 4 ingredients, but this time I won't be eating them haha!

Recipe:

Made a simple and sturdy wood soap mold with plastic dividers.

Laughable at how the names turned out. So many lessons learned when de-molding.

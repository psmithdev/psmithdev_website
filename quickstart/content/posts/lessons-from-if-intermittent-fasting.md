I've been IF for a few years now.  Very consistent the past 2 years or more.  Tracking and more awareness has helped a lot.  Stop eating around 10pm, begin eating next day 12-2pm

6/27-6/30/2022
4 day fast
last day best sleep ever in a long time, according to Oura ring

lessons
- the closer I eat and snack to bedtime, the worse sleep quality I will get
- try to stop eating 9pm-10pm, sooner the better
- east first two days Monday Tuesday.  Wednesday and Thursday my heart rate skyrocketed
- hard to focus when heartrate was up, I wish I measured it, had to lie down and wait it out
- I think my electrolytes and water intake was too low
- tried LMNT drink supplement once daily, has salt magnesium potassium
- 1/2 teaspoon salt with water daily

As soon as I entered the Colorado Convention Center, I was met with an atmosphere charged with the energy and anticipation of thousands of attendees, each there with the shared goal of exploring and understanding the world of psychedelics.\nWhat I Learned Throughout the five-day conference, I attended numerous lectures, panels, and workshops led by experts in the field. I was particularly struck by the presentation by A Conversation with Amanda Feilding and Rick Doblin, Ph.D., who spoke about conducting landmark studies with brain imaging. The insights I gained from this session alone have fundamentally shifted my understanding of LSD, MDMA, DMT and Psilocybin.\nAnother highlight was the workshop on Psychedelics as THe Great Disrupters: Reconstructing the Future of Mental Healthcare, led by Dr. Ben Sessa. The hands-on experience and the opportunity to interact directly with experts and fellow attendees provided invaluable practical knowledge that I will certainly apply in my life, family, friends, and mental health in general.\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687977325231/9d520d01-7b44-43c4-9772-a57538809ab5.jpeg align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nProgram Highlights\nPanels, workshops, and lectures from leaders in psychedelic research, education, policy, business, culture, and communities Pre- and post-conference workshops Exhibit hall and an interactive installation space featuring artists, musicians, and vendors from around the world​ Featured Speakers\nAaron Rodgers: Green Bay Packers Quarterback, NFL MVP, Super Bowl Champion Michael Pollan: Author, Co-Founder of the Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics John Mackey: Co-founder and Former CEO of Whole Foods Market, Co-creator and CEO of Love.Life Sasha Cohen: Two-time United States Olympian and Olympic Silver Medalist Lieutenant Diane M.

    "content": "Lately, my consistency with a mindfulness practice has been sticking. I first learned what is meditation in college and went down the rabbit hole of every app under the sun to try. Headspace, Calm, you name it. My current favorite is \u0026ldquo;Waking Up\u0026rdquo; by Sam Harris. These days, I prefer silence for long periods.\nMy saving grace has been finding a Zen Center from the suggestion of a friend I met at Esalen Institute. It has been a wonderful ride into the journey within, learning more about myself, and deepening my practice. There is so much to uncover, and let go of when we sit and \u0026ldquo;warm the cushion\u0026rdquo;.\nI do enjoy the pragmatic approach to Zen and learning about Buddhism. I can only imagine a world if more people took a few minutes out of their day or week to pause and focus on the breath. But none of that really matters. I can only lead by example and share with others what I enjoy and maybe other\u0026rsquo;s will share their curiosity too.\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1688401529436/81ae7fb2-2caa-43fe-9833-7f7c0c79144d.jpeg align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\n",
